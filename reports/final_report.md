# Final Report

## Introduction

This project compares four end-of-life pathways for post-consumer PET waste: mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, energy recovery, and landfill. The goal is to estimate the net greenhouse gas impact of each pathway and test how stable the ranking is under uncertainty.

## Methods

The model uses a functional unit of 1 metric ton of post-consumer PET waste. A baseline pathway model was implemented in `src/model.py`, and uncertainty was explored using Monte Carlo simulation in `src/uncertainty.py` with 5000 runs. Summary statistics were saved to CSV, and results were visualized using box plots and win-rate charts.

## Results

The current simulation shows mechanical recycling with the lowest mean GHG impact and the highest win rate. Chemical recycling is generally the second-best option, while energy recovery and landfill perform worse under the present assumptions. The results are shown in `results/figures/box_comparison.png` and `results/figures/win_percentage.png`.

## Discussion

Mechanical recycling performs best mainly because the model gives it a large credit for avoided virgin PET production. Energy recovery shows high uncertainty because its outcome depends strongly on combustion emissions and electricity displacement assumptions. These results should be treated as a first-pass estimate rather than a final literature benchmark.
Inspecting the specific runs where mechanical recycling did not win shows this tends to happen when collection rate and the virgin PET emission factor are both pushed toward the lower end of their ranges, meaning recycling loses its advantage specifically when less material is actually collected and virgin production is relatively less carbon-intensive than usual, reducing the credit recycling can claim.

## Conclusion

Under the current assumptions, mechanical recycling is the best-performing PET end-of-life pathway. However, the ranking remains sensitive to parameter choices, so the model should be refined with more detailed literature values and region-specific data in future work.
